# refreshable-token

The legacy implementation of RefreshableToken, RefreshableToken1, is broken : you can find a use case where the token will be refreshed when it should not be.

**TODO**

1. write a test prooving that the legacy implementation has a flaw

2. fix the implementation of RefreshableToken1 without breaking the API

3. fix the implementation of RefreshableToken1, this time you are allowed to break the API

Solution are located in package solution, don't spoil !
